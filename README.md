# Itexoft.Common

**Itexoft.Common** is a lean, shared codebase that gathers extension methods, small utilities, and lightweight tools that do not belong to any single application. Its purpose is to keep individual projects focused while still making common functionality easily accessible through a single NuGet package.

> Anything that is broadly useful across code-bases—but too general to live in a specific repository—should be placed here.
